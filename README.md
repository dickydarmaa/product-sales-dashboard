- **Pivot Tables:** Used to group and summarize data based on:
  - Total sales revenue by product
  - Annual sales trends by product category
  - Annual production quantities
  - Average customer age by location
- **Descriptive Analysis:** Multi-dimensional analysis to identify patterns and correlations between variables.
- **Visualization:** The analyzed data was then visualized using Tableau Public and Chart.js for the interactive dashboard.
